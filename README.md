Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in physics, governing the motion of objects under the influence of gravity. This project presents an interactive Projectile Motion Simulator developed using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, allowing users to visualize and analyze projectile trajectories. The simulator enables students to modify initial velocity, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration to observe real-time motion dynamics. By leveraging numerical computation techniques, the system dynamically updates position, velocity, and flight path based on kinematic equations. This tool serves as an educational resource for engineering students to understand motion principles in an engaging and interactive manner.
